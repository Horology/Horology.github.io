      <h2> Heated Garden </h2>
      <p><center>Due to its location between two continental plates, Iceland has been using geothermal energy beneath Earth’s surface for decades to heat homes and greenhouses generate electricity. These sources of renewable energy allowing the country to sustain by itself have been the pride of Iceland for years. Professor Robert Dell is currently using the wasted hot water from this energy to heat soil, allowing plants to grow in Iceland without the use of greenhouses and more energy efficiency. This garden uses a mechanism similar to that of the heated sidewalks, which is a government project that repurpose wasted water from households to go under sidewalks. By using steam pipes to heat the soil above it, plants that would not be able to live in Iceland’s natural climate now strives there. We currently two gardens at the moment; One in Keilir Institute of Technology and one in Agricultural University in Iceland. Another one is being built in a residential area. This economically viable method will allow individual families to grow their plants without the use of greenhouses.  This experiment of heating began in 2008 and data has been collected every year since then. This year however, the temperature of the steam pipes increased to an extent that the plants died from overheating. The garden is being renewed and plants are now being grown to reinitiate the project.</center> </p>

      <h2> Thermoelectric Generator  </h2>
      <p><center> The wasted heat energy from the steam water pipes is utilized to our advantage by installing thermoelectric generators onto the pipes. The generator functions by using the thermoelectric modules to converting the thermal energy to electrical energy. There are two components to the thermoelectric modules, the hot side and the cool side. The hot side of the thermoelectric generator is clamped onto the surface of the steam pipe. The cool side was near the steam pipe as well, however, an aluminum heat sink was attached to it allowing radiating heat energy to convect upwards. By utilizing the temperature difference between the two surface, the module was able to generate enough electricity to power a 12 V LED module.   </center> </p>
