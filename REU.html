      <h2> Manufacturing Microfibrillar Adhesives  </h2>
      <p><center> Significant progress has been made in the
      	technological fields involved in the production of numerous
      	adhesives designed for a wide range of applications. Many of
      	these chemical adhesives lack control, reusability, and
      	diversity when compared to directional dry adhesives.
      	Microfibrillar adhesives, modeled after the natural adhesion of
      	gecko toe pads, adhere to metal, glass, plastic, wood
      	panels, and similar surfaces.
      	The gecko-based adhesive presents a very small area
      	of contact when unloaded. When the fibers are loaded in a
      	general shear direction, they bend. The bending of the fibers
      	results in a greater contact area and greater adhesion
      	capabilities. Because of this, a high aspect ratio between the
      	width and depth of the fibers is required in order to have
      	adequate adhesion.
      	The fabrication method introduced is similar to the method introduced by Stanford University. A dicing blade is spun at 10,000 RPM to machine the surface of the mold material. A polycarbonate or glass substrate is held
      	fixed by aluminum vice. Two actuators and a micrometer stage
      	is attached to the vice, allowing the control over the three
      	planar degrees of freedom. The movements of the actuators
      	are automated by the SEM Terminal codes and the MATLAB
  		program. </center> </p>
